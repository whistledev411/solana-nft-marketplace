# Contract interaction scripts

To run any of this scripts you need to prepare correct environment:
1. Install node
2. Run `npm i` in root project directory
3. Place your wallet credentials as "wallet.json" in /scripts directory
4. Edit env file with NFT mint address, that is owned by the wallet you provided

You can run each script with this command:
`node --experimental-json-modules <filename>.js`

As the output you will receive transaction hash for your interactions.

Currently only available network is **devnet** and you need to have devnet SOLs to proceed with transactions
